This is a toy chord chart for plotting the communications of a certain sentiment to and from team members 

I think I'll store the data as a kind of csv

Team Member list: 
1. Bob 
2. Mary 
3. John 

3 is a good start for now. I can work on making it modular later 

The key issue is getting the data into a proper matrix


Chord charts have a few key objects 

CHORDS 
Chords represent bi-directional info from one node to another 
They have start angles and end angles, representative of their place on a circle 


ARCS 
Basically a circle with the values on it 

RIBBONS 
The little drawing thingies that visually represent the chords
